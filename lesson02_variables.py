# variavles are flexible, you create of update another variable, like so:

# Challenge 1: Rename Variables  
# Change the variable names x, y, z below to more descriptive names. 
# given:
# x = "Radia Perlman"
# y = 34
# z = "Networking Engineer"

Name = "Radio Perlman"
Age = 34
Job = "Networking Engineer"

# Challenge 2: Update Variables  
# Create a variable called 'count' with a value of 10.  
# Use another variable to increase 'count' by 5
# Print the result

count = 10 
x = count + 5 
print(count)


# Challenge 3: Swap Variables  
# Given variables num = 4 and y = "hello".  
# Swap the values so that x = "hello" and y = 4. 
# Use a temporary variable.  
# Hint: You will need to create one new variable. 

x = 4
y = "hello"

temp = x 
x = y 
y = temp

print(y)
